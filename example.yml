# The following list describes objects in the scene.
#
# Three types of object are supported: mesh, sphere and plane.
# Though anything can be expressed as a mesh, the other two are provided as simple and faster alternatives.
#
# For mesh type:
# A model file must be specified as `model` field.
# Only PLY format is supported.
# Vertex data must be in `vertex` element.
# Vertex indices must be in `vertex_indices` element, must be a list of size 3.
#
# A texture image file can be specified as `texture` field.
# The image format can be PNG, JPEG and BMP.
# If specified, the vertex element must have properties `u` and `v`, as texture coordinates.
#
# For sphere type:
# The radius and the center point must be specified as `radius` and `center` fields, respectively.
#
# For plane type:
# The normal vector and a control point must be specified as `normal` and `point` fields, respectively.
#
# Several fields are applicable for all types.
# For a field supposed to be a triple, you can simply specify one number `s` to denote `[s, s, s]`.
#
# A color is denoted as a triple `[r, g, b]`.
# The components in normal color are between 0.0 and 1.0, but you can also specify bigger values.
# color: object color, ignored if texture is supplied
# emission: light color for lighting objects, default to `0`
#
# The material is one of diffuse, specular and refraction.
# The value is corresponding string.
# For refraction type, you can specify an additional refractive index `n` as `[refraction, n]`.
# material: object material, default to `diffuse`
#
# The transform is applied in the order of `scale` -> `rotate` -> `translate`.
# scale: a scale factor for all axes
# rotate: a `[angle, axis]` pair denoting the rotation,
#   where `angle` is the rotation angle in degree and `axis` is a vector to denote the rotation axis.
# translate: a `[x, y, z]` triple denoting the translation
